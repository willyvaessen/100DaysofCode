# 7 August 2023

Today I will mostly be working on integrating my profile warpper into a larger website.
I've been working with ChatGPT to get my site to the point where it is now and I'm quite happy with the result so far. The site is published (of course) to my [website](https://willyvaessen.nl/) on 7 August 2023.
This morning, I loaded my index.html to ChatGPT and it gave me a very nice feedback.

## I like the comments given by ChatGPT

Based on the provided HTML code, it looks like you are building a personal website for Willy Vaessen, who is a system administrator, web developer, and IT enthusiast. Here's a breakdown of the main sections of the website:

1. Meta Information:
    - The document is in HTML5 format, with English language specified.
    - There are meta tags for charset and viewport to define the character encoding and responsive behavior on different devices.

2. CSS and External Libraries:
    - The website uses custom CSS files for styling.
    - The website uses the Font Awesome library to display icons.
    - There is a reset.css file to reset default styling across different browsers.

3. Landscape Text:
    - This section appears only when the user turns their mobile device in landscape mode. It asks the user to rotate their device to portrait mode for a better experience.

4. Profile Wrapper:
    - The main content of the website is contained within a "profile-wrapper" class.
    - Profile Picture Section: Displays the profile picture of Willy Vaessen using an overlay image.

5. Wrapper Header:
    - Contains the header title "Willy Vaessen," headline, and location information.

6. Profile Spotlight:
    - Initially used to highlight important things, but now shows a button.

7. Profile Content:
    - Contains introductory text about the author of the website (Willy Vaessen).

8. Hidden Mail Section:
    - Contains an email address that is hidden by default and will only be visible on user interaction (perhaps on clicking a link).

9. Social Links:
    - Contains a collection of social media links represented by icons from Font Awesome.
    - The visible social media links include LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, Discord, and a "Buy me a coffee/beer" link.

Overall, the website seems to be a personal portfolio site with information about Willy Vaessen's skills and contact information, as well as links to his social media profiles and other platforms. Some sections may be placeholders for future content or interactive features.

## ChatGPT checking my stylesheet:

The provided CSS code is a stylesheet that defines the styling for a website. Here is a summary of the main sections and their functionalities:

1. **General Styles**: This section includes general styles for the entire website, such as setting the box-sizing property to border-box, setting the height of the HTML and body elements to 100%, and defining the default font-family and text color.

2. **Spacers**: This section defines classes for adding vertical spacing between elements using height values.

3. **Variables**: The :root section defines a CSS variable (--wrapper-background-color) that is used for setting the background color of various wrapper elements throughout the website.

4. **Profile Wrapper Styles**: This section defines the styles for the profile wrapper, which contains the user's profile information.

5. **Profile Picture**: This section styles the profile picture area, including positioning the image and adding an overlay image on top.

6. **Header Styles**: Styles for the header section, including the title and headline.

7. **Profile Spotlight Area**: This section defines styles for the profile spotlight area, which includes a button and the main content.

8. **Social Links**: Styling for the social links section, including the icons and their hover effects.

9. **Footer Styles**: Styles for the website footer.

10. **Hidden Element Styles**: Styling for elements that are hidden and shown based on user interaction, such as clicking a link to reveal an email address.

11. **Media Query for Landscape Orientation**: This media query targets landscape-oriented mobile devices and hides the profile wrapper while showing a warning message to view the site in portrait mode or on a larger screen.

Overall, this stylesheet provides a structured and visually appealing design for the website's profile section, including responsive styles for different screen orientations. However, without seeing the HTML code that utilizes these CSS classes and styles, it's challenging to visualize the actual layout and appearance of the website. The functionality and appearance will also depend on how these styles are combined with HTML elements on the website.


## A smallPython project, just to try something out
With the help of ChatGPT I started creating a small application that allows me to create and use text snippets. In my work, I use the same text a lot of times. Having to copy them from the notepad application takes quite some steps, so I want to simplify that.
