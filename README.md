# 100 Days of Code (#100daysofcode)

In this repository, I will upload my projects in order for me to write some code 
every day, starting 1 August 2023.


## 1 August 2023

Today I've been playing with ChatGPT and made a small responsive website, intended 
to be used on mobile phone devices. The website contains no more than a header, a 
textbox and a button. The idea was/is to display the text that is typed into the 
textbox as text in the main content section, but I haven't been able to get that 
working yet.


## 2 August 2023

Today I've been working on a small, simple template for a mobile only website,
assisted by ChatGPT in order to create something of a template to work with for 
future mobile sites.


## 3 August 2023

Today I've updated the template that I made yesterday, to use the color scheme 
that I want my website to use. Not a lot of big changes right now, but I'll 
be tweaking this template a little more tomorrow. Eventually, this should become 
the mobile version of my website, being part of my responsive website.


## 4 August 2023

Today I'm working on my (mobile) about me page. Although it would be a lot 
easier to use the About.me website for that, I want to create my own. What 
kind of web designer would I be if I didn't build it myself, right? I've been 
looking at an example page from someone I know and used that as inspiration to 
build my own.
It is nowhere near finished, so I'll continue with that on day 5.


## 5 August 2023

Continuing work on my (mobile) about me page. Not too happy with yesterday's 
result, so I might start over from scratch, starting from the outside in:
- Create a wrapper
- Add a header section
- Add a content section
- etc...

Since AI will be a thing of the near future, I will ask ChatGPT to assist me 
in the process.
Quite happy with the result so far today.  The mobile version looks like this 
now:


Of course, it's nowhere near finished, but it's a great start as far as I'm 
concerned.


## 6 August 2023

Today I'll continue working on my (mobile) website that I built yesterday. 
Overall, I'm quite happy with how it turned out, but there is some tweaking 
left to do.
The First thing I'll look at is getting rid of unnecessary scroll bars, especially 
on large screens.

At the end of the day, I ended up redoing the whole thing, but I'm quite happy 
with the result. As far as I can see, there are no scroll bars now on mobile, on 
which I concentrated today.
Tomorrow I want to work on larger screen sizes.


## 7 August 2023

This morning I already made some minor adjustments to yesterday's work. The 
responsive part of the site, when turned to landscape mode
on mobile screens, appeared to be a little too large on my iPhone 13 mini, so I 
shrunk that a little.
Today I want to try and use the base that I created yesterday in a desktop website, 
but there's also the end of my summer 
vacation, so back to work again.


## 8 August 2023

Today I'll be working with ChatGPT to create some sort of template that can hold 
small pieces of website, like widgets. 
Each widget should contain the GUI part of some JavaScript code that I think 
of to practice JavaScript.

The basic layout of this template is now finished, although a lot of work is 
still needed to get it perfect(ly right for me).


## 9 August 2023

I started today with some small additions/tweaks to the profile/about me website.
To-do list for today:
* Build the layout for larger screens
* Make the layout responsive
* Add my profile wrapper to the layout.

I've decided to actually start building the layout from scratch, layer by layer.
I'm not sure yet how this will work 
out, but I believe it is the best way to go.

To define the best layout, I'm making the following assumptions:
Most monitors are HD (1920x1080 pixels) which is a pretty good point to start 
from for larger screens.
I use an iPhone 13 mini, which has a 375x667 pixel resolution. 
I want my (mobile) site to look
good on my phone as well, so I'll use that as a reference.
I use iPad mini 6 for most of my media consumption which has a resolution of 
2266x1488 resolution. 
I'm not sure yet how that translates to websites, but so far it looked good on 
my iPad.
- The Firefox developer tools use a resolution of 810x1080 for iPadOS emulation.
- Chrome developer tools use 768 x 1024 for iPad mini and 720x1180 for iPad Air 
emulation


## 10 August 2023

Yesterday was a little less successful as I hoped.
I didn't really get a lot of time to code, and when 
I did have some time late night, I was so foolish to delete the one html 
file that had some progress. 
Today I'm starting over to make up for what went wrong yesterday.


## 11 August 2023

Today I didn't have a lot of time to work on the site layout. 
During late night hours, I came up with the idea of filling my content area 
with the contents of a markdown file and I stumbled upon the Showdown
markdown to HTML converter. 
I played around with it a little, and I like it, although I have some tweaking 
to do.


## 12 August 2023

Really not much coding today, rather browsing the Wayback Machine looking at 
old copies of what used to be my websites.
Nothing pretty, actually, but it was out there.
I'm going to try and find a way to incorporate that history as part of my 
soon-to-be new design.


## 13 August 2023

A quiet day this was. 
Time for a break, so just a little bit of coding, in 
order to get something started for my 
overview of old website versions I had made in the past.


## 14 August 2023

After not having done a lot yesterday, today it's time to continue working on 
the larger screen layouts.
I saw some little things that I need to work out, and I'm thinking of getting 
rid of the current nav-area position/layout.
I have the feeling that it's not working out as intended.


## 15 August 2023

* Added favicon to my website design. 
I reused a logo I once designed with my initials: WV
* Added Cantora font to the design. 
This is the font I used in 2020 to create my WV logo, and I still like the 
typography, so I'll stick with that.
* removed the nav-bar part of my html.
I didn't like the way it ended up, so I chose to allow the profile wrapper to 
become wider on larger screens.
I will need to do some cleaning up in my stylesheet though.


## 16 August 2023

Today there wasn't much time for coding. 
I brought a visit to the Efteling theme park today.
Made a tiny start with marked.js to convert markdown to html, in order to 
enable easy maintenance on the website content.
It looks promising, but there's a lot to learn about that.


## 17 August 2023

Today I worked on the Responsive Web Design course on FreeCodeCamp.org and 
took the time, effort and liberty of 
publishing my result on my [personal website](https://willyvaessen.nl/freeCodeCamp/).
I built the first project (**[Cat Photo App](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-by-building-a-cat-photo-app/)** 
a while ago, now I finished the **[Caf√© Menu](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu/)**. Next step will be the 
**[Colored Markers](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-css-colors-by-building-a-set-of-colored-markers/)**) project.


## 18 August 2023

Today I finished the next bit at Free Code Camp: Colored Markers, teaching 
more about colors in CSS.
Next up (probably tomorrow) will be the [Registration Form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-forms-by-building-a-registration-form/) challenge.

Besides all that, I have worked with ChatGPT a little, getting some text for 
my personal website. 
Since I will be using that text, I'm going to update the 
site today as well, but only in terms of a little content.
One thing leading to another, I implemented a language selector on my website. 
It's now possible to toggle between Dutch (default) and English language by 
clicking/tapping the flag icon next to my name.


## 19 August 2023

Not a lot of spare time today, as we are going to visit Diergarde Blijdorp.
I made a start with the next lesson on FreeCodeCamp, building a Registration Form. 
32% in now.


## 20 August 2023

Today was the last day in Rotterdam, so not much time to code until we got home.
In the early hours of today I made a start with the Registration form on 
FreeCodeCamp, and I finished that when we got back home.
I made an archive of my current (online version) website to work from there. 
The language toggler does seem to work as intended now, so I'll keep it the way 
it is.
Tomorrow I want to build a sort of credits-page, to explain how my website is 
built, and what resources I have used.

## 21 August 2023

First day of the week in terms of work. 
Third week in my 100 Days of Code challenge.
Today I want to work on the next assignment on FreeCodeCamp.org and try to 
build a site credits page for my website. 
A page where I can mention the resources and link to them in one separate 
area of my website.


## 22 August 2023

Although I'm not sure if I'm going to make it, in terms of time, I want to try 
and complete one lessen on FreeCodeCamp daily as well as work on one JavaScript
challenge on the site as well. 
Kind of "by accident" I came across a list of 
those challenges, and I think it would help me to learn more about them.
I did some reorganizing of my code/files, hoping that this will help me work more
organized.
Made a start on my portfolio page and placed all small projects that I have
made previously in the portfolio folder.

That is pretty much it for today. Now to spend some quality time with my girlfriend.


## 23 August 2023
Today was quite a busy day, work-wise. 
I didn't have much time during the day to write any code, although I did 
manage to get Webstation back up and running on my Synology NAS, including
some certificates. 
I seem to have found the way to go now. 
That means I could start looking at self-hosting all my website stuff again.

During the evening, I worked on the next lesson on FreeCodeCamp about Typography.
I'll be building a nutrition table.


## 24 August 2023
Today I hope to finish a little earlier than I did yesterday. 
It was quite a late night, because I was unable to code during the day.
Today I will continue on FreeCodeCamp, with the next lesson first.
If time permits, I'll look at one or more JavaScript challenges, but I will 
have to look into Sharepoint as well today, for work.

I prepared my new domains (it-dudes.network, casa-vako.network and willy.codes) 
for email use. 
Now I need to think of a good strategy to organize my mail accounts better.

### 21:00

I remember why I stopped the JavaScript lessons on freeCodeCamp.
The second lesson is teaching me to use 'var' for declaring variables, while 
insted we were taught in the FSD bootcamp not to use that anymore. 
Instead we should user 'let' and 'const'.
However, after working on some more of these lessons, I saw that the difference
between 'var' and 'let' is explained.
I have now finished 34 out of 113 assignments.

Added a folder for willy.codes website, and adapted my personal website 
template for use there. At least for the time being.


## 25 August 2023
I haven't gotten to working on the freeCodeCamp lessons today, but I did work
on a Node.js course on Udemy, which is quite enlightening to me.

## 26 August 2023
Yesterday I spent quite some time on Udemy, following the node.js course by 
[Ryan Dhungel](https://www.udemy.com/user/e4938520-fe50-4d1b-b78d-4188406b14a9/).
Although it seems that the node.js version (10.x) used in the course is from quite 
a while back (2019 as I've seen in one video, I've been able to follow the steps 
so far, enjoying what I've learnt.

I'll continue today, but I also want to try and find the time for a lesson on
freeCodeCamp, which I totally skipped today.

Another idea that popped into my mind today was to build some overview 
of all the registered domains I have. 
The amount is growing, and it's hard to keep track of them, especially 
when they are registered in different places.

Following that, I'm actually looking for a good way to keep track of my ideas.
I get some ideas sometimes, but tend to forget about them, because of not writing 
them down anywhere.


## 27 August 2023

The past few days, I've been working on some Node.js tutorials/lessons which 
helped me with setting up a simple web server. 
Now, it's time to take it a step further and get it connected to a database.
I'm choosing MariaDB for that purpose, as that is running on my Synology NAS.
Using the guides on [MariusHosting](https://mariushosting.com/) is installed 
MariaDB into a Docker container.
Now I will try the [guide on Dev.to](https://dev.to/probablyrealrob/getting-started-with-mariadb-using-docker-and-node-js-3djg)
that should help me get my Node.js app connected to the database. 
That is the plan for today.

I seem to have some trouble with using the "dotenv" package.
As soon as I try to use variables from my .env file, my app crashes and I can't 
seem to figure out why.


## 28 August 2023

A busy day today, with a long but interesting meeting.
It seems that we're going to have a challenging time ahead at work.
A busy day also means I haven't had the time to code yet, unfortunately.
I'll see what I can do tonight, though.


## 29 August 2023

Another busy day, but filled with some fun activities this time. I've been 
figuring out how to get some data from our Sharepoint site, using the REST API
that is available.

Furthermore, I'm working on the [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) 
tutorial, as a refresher to my JavaScript knowledge. I will post my updates to
the corresponding [repository](https://github.com/willyvaessen/willy.javascript.info).


## 30 August 2023
August is coming to an end. 30 Days going forward in coding, learning and building.
Still working on the JavaScript.info tutorial, but also busy with finding out how 
to work with the Sharepoint REST API for work.
