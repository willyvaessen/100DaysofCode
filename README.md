# 100DaysofCode

In this repository I will upload my projects in order for me to write some code every day, starting 1 August 2023.

## 1 August 2023
Today I've been playing with ChatGPT and made a small responsive website, intended to be used on mobile phone devices. The website contains no more than a header, a textbox and a button. The idea was/is to display the text that is typed into the textbox as text in the main content section, but I havean't been able to get that working yet.

Today I've been working on a samll, simple template for a mobile only website, assisted by ChatGPT in order to create something of a template to work with for future mobile sites.

## 3 August 2023
Today I've update the template that I made yesterday, to use the color scheme that I want my website to use. Not a lot of big changes right now, but I'll be tweaking this template a little more tomorrow. Eventually this should become the mobile version of my website, being part of my responsive website.
