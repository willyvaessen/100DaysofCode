# 100DaysofCode

In this repository I will upload my projects in order for me to write some code every day, starting 1 August 2023.

## 1 August 2023
Today I've been playing with ChatGPT and made a small responsive website, intended to be used on mobile phone devices. The website contains no more than a header, a textbox and a button. The idea was/is to display the text that is typed into the textbox as text in the main content section, but I havean't been able to get that working yet.

## 2 August 2023
Today I've been working on a small, simple template for a mobile only website, assisted by ChatGPT in order to create something of a template to work with for future mobile sites.

## 3 August 2023
Today I've update the template that I made yesterday, to use the color scheme that I want my website to use. Not a lot of big changes right now, but I'll be tweaking this template a little more tomorrow. Eventually this should become the mobile version of my website, being part of my responsive website.

## 4 August 2023
Today I'm working on my (mobile) about me page. Although it would be a lot easier to use the About.me website for that, I want to create my own. What kind of web designer would I be if I didn't build it myself, right? I've been looking at an example page from someone I know at used that as inspiration to buidl my own.
It is nowhere near finished, so I'll continue with that on day 5.

## 5 August 2023
Continuing work on my (mobile) about me page. Not too happy with yesterday's result, so I might start over from scratch, starting from the outside in:
- Create a wrapper
- Add a header section
- Add a content section
- etc...

Since AI will be a thing of the near future, I will ask ChatGPT to assist me in the process.
Quite happy with the result so far today.  The mobile version looks like this now:

Of course it's nowhere near finished, but it's a great start as far as I'm concerned.
