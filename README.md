# 100DaysofCode

In this repository I will upload my projects in order for me to write some code 
every day, starting 1 August 2023.

## 1 August 2023
Today I've been playing with ChatGPT and made a small responsive website, intended 
to be used on mobile phone devices. The website contains no more than a header, a 
textbox and a button. The idea was/is to display the text that is typed into the 
textbox as text in the main content section, but I havean't been able to get that 
working yet.

## 2 August 2023
Today I've been working on a small, simple template for a mobile only website,
assisted by ChatGPT in order to create something of a template to work with for future mobile sites.

## 3 August 2023
Today I've update the template that I made yesterday, to use the color scheme 
that I want my website to use. Not a lot of big changes right now, but I'll 
be tweaking this template a little more tomorrow. Eventually this should become 
the mobile version of my website, being part of my responsive website.

## 4 August 2023
Today I'm working on my (mobile) about me page. Although it would be a lot 
easier to use the About.me website for that, I want to create my own. What 
kind of web designer would I be if I didn't build it myself, right? I've been looking at an example page from someone I know at used that as inspiration to buidl my own.
It is nowhere near finished, so I'll continue with that on day 5.

## 5 August 2023
Continuing work on my (mobile) about me page. Not too happy with yesterday's 
result, so I might start over from scratch, starting from the outside in:
- Create a wrapper
- Add a header section
- Add a content section
- etc...

Since AI will be a thing of the near future, I will ask ChatGPT to assist me 
in the process.
Quite happy with the result so far today.  The mobile version looks like this 
now:


Of course, it's nowhere near finished, but it's a great start as far as I'm 
concerned.

## 6 August 2023
Today I'll continue working on my (mobile) website that I built yesterday. 
Overall I'm quite happy with how it turned out but there is some tweaking left to do.
First thing I'll look at, is getting rid of unnecessary scroll bars, especially 
on large screens.

At the end of the day, I ended up redoing the whole thing, but I'm quite happy 
with the result. As far as I can see, there are no scroll bars now on mobile, on 
which I concentrated today.
Tomorrow I want to work on larger screen sizes.

## 7 August 2023
This morning I already made some minor adjustments to yesterday's work. The 
responsive part of the site, when turned to landscape mode
on mobile screens, appeared to be a little too large on my iPhone 13 mini, so I 
shrunk that a little.
Today I want to try and use the base that I created yesterday in a desktop website, 
but there's also the end of my summer 
vacation, so back to work again.

## 8 August 2023
Today I'll be working with ChatGPT to create some sort of template, that can hold 
small pieces of website, like widgets. Each widget should contain the GUI part of some 
JavaScript code that I think of to practice JavaScript.

The basic layout of this template is now finished, although a lot of work is still 
needed to get it perfect(ly right for me).


## 9 August 2023
I started today with some small additions/tweaks to the profile/about me website.
To-do list for today:
* Build the layout for larger screens
* Make the layout responsive
* Add my profile wrapper to the layout.

I've decided to actually start building the layout from scratch, layer by layer.
I'm not sure yet how this will work 
out, but I believe it is the best way to go.

To define the best layout, I'm making the following assumptions:
Most monitors are HD (1920x1080 pixels) which is a pretty good point to start from for larger screens.
I use an iPhone 13 mini, which has a 375x667 pixels resolution. I want my (mobile) site to look
good on my phone as well, so I'll use that as a reference.
I use an iPad mini 6 for most of my media consumption which has a resolution of 2266x1488 resolution. 
I'm not sure yet how that translates to websites, but so far it looked good on my iPad.
- The Firefox developer tools use an 810x1080 resolution for iPadOS emulation.
- Chrome developer tools use 768 x 1024 for iPad mini and 720x1180 for iPad Air emulation


## 10 August 2023
Yesterday was a little less successful as I hoped. I din't really get a lot of time to code and when 
I did have some time late night, I was so dumb to delete the one html file that had some progress. 
Today I'm starting over to make up for what went wrong yesterday.

## 11 August 2023
Today I didn't have a lot of time to work on the site layout. During late night hours, I came up with 
the idea of filling my content area with the contents of a markdown file and I stumbled upon the Showdown
markdown to HTML converter. I played around with it a little and I like it, although I have some tweaking to do.

## 12 August 2023
Really not much coding today, rather browsing the Wayback Machine looking at old copies of what used to be my websites.
Nothing pretty, actually, but it was out there.
I'm going to try and find a way to incorporate that history as part of my soon-to-be new design.


## 13 August 2023
A quiet day this was. Time for a break, so just a little bit of coding, in order to get something started for my 
overview of old website versions I had made in the past.

## 14 August 2023
After not having done a lot yesterday, today it's time to continue working on the larger screen layouts.
I saw some little things that I need to work out, and I'm thinking of getting rid of the current nav-area position/layout.
I have the feeling that it's not working out as intended.
