In this repository I will upload my projects in order for me to write some code every day, starting 1 August 2023.

## 1 August 2023
Today I've been playing with ChatGPT and made a small responsive website, intended to be used on mobile phone devices. The website contains no more than a header, a textbox and a button. The idea was/is to display the text that is typed into the textbox as text in the main content section, but I havean't been able to get that working yet.
