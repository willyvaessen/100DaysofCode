# 100 Days of Code (#100daysofcode)

In this repository, I will upload my projects in order for me to write some code 
every day, starting 1 August 2023.


## 1 August 2023

Today I've been playing with ChatGPT and made a small responsive website, intended 
to be used on mobile phone devices. The website contains no more than a header, a 
textbox and a button. The idea was/is to display the text that is typed into the 
textbox as text in the main content section, but I haven't been able to get that 
working yet.


## 2 August 2023

Today I've been working on a small, simple template for a mobile only website,
assisted by ChatGPT in order to create something of a template to work with for 
future mobile sites.


## 3 August 2023

Today I've updated the template that I made yesterday, to use the color scheme 
that I want my website to use. Not a lot of big changes right now, but I'll 
be tweaking this template a little more tomorrow. Eventually, this should become 
the mobile version of my website, being part of my responsive website.


## 4 August 2023

Today I'm working on my (mobile) about me page. Although it would be a lot 
easier to use the About.me website for that, I want to create my own. What 
kind of web designer would I be if I didn't build it myself, right? I've been 
looking at an example page from someone I know and used that as inspiration to 
build my own.
It is nowhere near finished, so I'll continue with that on day 5.


## 5 August 2023

Continuing work on my (mobile) about me page. Not too happy with yesterday's 
result, so I might start over from scratch, starting from the outside in:
- Create a wrapper
- Add a header section
- Add a content section
- etc...

Since AI will be a thing of the near future, I will ask ChatGPT to assist me 
in the process.
Quite happy with the result so far today.  The mobile version looks like this 
now:


Of course, it's nowhere near finished, but it's a great start as far as I'm 
concerned.


## 6 August 2023

Today I'll continue working on my (mobile) website that I built yesterday. 
Overall, I'm quite happy with how it turned out, but there is some tweaking 
left to do.
The First thing I'll look at is getting rid of unnecessary scroll bars, especially 
on large screens.

At the end of the day, I ended up redoing the whole thing, but I'm quite happy 
with the result. As far as I can see, there are no scroll bars now on mobile, on 
which I concentrated today.
Tomorrow I want to work on larger screen sizes.


## 7 August 2023

This morning I already made some minor adjustments to yesterday's work. The 
responsive part of the site, when turned to landscape mode
on mobile screens, appeared to be a little too large on my iPhone 13 mini, so I 
shrunk that a little.
Today I want to try and use the base that I created yesterday in a desktop website, 
but there's also the end of my summer 
vacation, so back to work again.


## 8 August 2023

Today I'll be working with ChatGPT to create some sort of template that can hold 
small pieces of website, like widgets. 
Each widget should contain the GUI part of some JavaScript code that I think 
of to practice JavaScript.

The basic layout of this template is now finished, although a lot of work is 
still needed to get it perfect(ly right for me).


## 9 August 2023

I started today with some small additions/tweaks to the profile/about me website.
To-do list for today:
* Build the layout for larger screens
* Make the layout responsive
* Add my profile wrapper to the layout.

I've decided to actually start building the layout from scratch, layer by layer.
I'm not sure yet how this will work 
out, but I believe it is the best way to go.

To define the best layout, I'm making the following assumptions:
Most monitors are HD (1920x1080 pixels) which is a pretty good point to start 
from for larger screens.
I use an iPhone 13 mini, which has a 375x667 pixel resolution. 
I want my (mobile) site to look
good on my phone as well, so I'll use that as a reference.
I use iPad mini 6 for most of my media consumption which has a resolution of 
2266x1488 resolution. 
I'm not sure yet how that translates to websites, but so far it looked good on 
my iPad.
- The Firefox developer tools use a resolution of 810x1080 for iPadOS emulation.
- Chrome developer tools use 768 x 1024 for iPad mini and 720x1180 for iPad Air 
emulation


## 10 August 2023

Yesterday was a little less successful as I hoped.
I didn't really get a lot of time to code, and when 
I did have some time late night, I was so foolish to delete the one html 
file that had some progress. 
Today I'm starting over to make up for what went wrong yesterday.


## 11 August 2023

Today I didn't have a lot of time to work on the site layout. 
During late night hours, I came up with the idea of filling my content area 
with the contents of a markdown file and I stumbled upon the Showdown
markdown to HTML converter. 
I played around with it a little, and I like it, although I have some tweaking 
to do.


## 12 August 2023

Really not much coding today, rather browsing the Wayback Machine looking at 
old copies of what used to be my websites.
Nothing pretty, actually, but it was out there.
I'm going to try and find a way to incorporate that history as part of my 
soon-to-be new design.


## 13 August 2023

A quiet day this was. 
Time for a break, so just a little bit of coding, in 
order to get something started for my 
overview of old website versions I had made in the past.


## 14 August 2023

After not having done a lot yesterday, today it's time to continue working on 
the larger screen layouts.
I saw some little things that I need to work out, and I'm thinking of getting 
rid of the current nav-area position/layout.
I have the feeling that it's not working out as intended.


## 15 August 2023

* Added favicon to my website design. 
I reused a logo I once designed with my initials: WV
* Added Cantora font to the design. 
This is the font I used in 2020 to create my WV logo, and I still like the 
typography, so I'll stick with that.
* removed the nav-bar part of my html.
I didn't like the way it ended up, so I chose to allow the profile wrapper to 
become wider on larger screens.
I will need to do some cleaning up in my stylesheet though.


## 16 August 2023

Today there wasn't much time for coding. 
I brought a visit to the Efteling theme park today.
Made a tiny start with marked.js to convert markdown to html, in order to 
enable easy maintenance on the website content.
It looks promising, but there's a lot to learn about that.


## 17 August 2023

Today I worked on the Responsive Web Design course on FreeCodeCamp.org and 
took the time, effort and liberty of 
publishing my result on my [personal website](https://willyvaessen.nl/freeCodeCamp/).
I built the first project (**[Cat Photo App](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-by-building-a-cat-photo-app/)** 
a while ago, now I finished the **[Caf√© Menu](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu/)**. Next step will be the 
**[Colored Markers](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-css-colors-by-building-a-set-of-colored-markers/)**) project.


## 18 August 2023

Today I finished the next bit at Free Code Camp: Colored Markers, teaching 
more about colors in CSS.
Next up (probably tomorrow) will be the [Registration Form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-forms-by-building-a-registration-form/) challenge.

Besides all that, I have worked with ChatGPT a little, getting some text for 
my personal website. 
Since I will be using that text, I'm going to update the 
site today as well, but only in terms of a little content.
One thing leading to another, I implemented a language selector on my website. 
It's now possible to toggle between Dutch (default) and English language by 
clicking/tapping the flag icon next to my name.


## 19 August 2023

Not a lot of spare time today, as we are going to visit Diergarde Blijdorp.
I made a start with the next lesson on FreeCodeCamp, building a Registration Form. 
32% in now.


## 20 August 2023

Today was the last day in Rotterdam, so not much time to code until we got home.
In the early hours of today I made a start with the Registration form on 
FreeCodeCamp, and I finished that when we got back home.
I made an archive of my current (online version) website to work from there. 
The language toggler does seem to work as intended now, so I'll keep it the way 
it is.
Tomorrow I want to build a sort of credits-page, to explain how my website is 
built, and what resources I have used.

## 21 August 2023

First day of the week in terms of work. 
Third week in my 100 Days of Code challenge.
Today I want to work on the next assignment on FreeCodeCamp.org and try to 
build a site credits page for my website. 
A page where I can mention the resources and link to them in one separate 
area of my website.


## 22 August 2023

Although I'm not sure if I'm going to make it, in terms of time, I want to try 
and complete one lessen on FreeCodeCamp daily as well as work on one JavaScript
challenge on the site as well. 
Kind of "by accident" I came across a list of 
those challenges, and I think it would help me to learn more about them.
I did some reorganizing of my code/files, hoping that this will help me work more
organized.
Made a start on my portfolio page and placed all small projects that I have
made previously in the portfolio folder.

That is pretty much it for today. Now to spend some quality time with my girlfriend.


## 23 August 2023
Today was quite a busy day, work-wise. 
I didn't have much time during the day to write any code, although I did 
manage to get Webstation back up and running on my Synology NAS, including
some certificates. 
I seem to have found the way to go now. 
That means I could start looking at self-hosting all my website stuff again.

During the evening, I worked on the next lesson on FreeCodeCamp about Typography.
I'll be building a nutrition table.


## 24 August 2023
Today I hope to finish a little earlier than I did yesterday. 
It was quite a late night, because I was unable to code during the day.
Today I will continue on FreeCodeCamp, with the next lesson first.
If time permits, I'll look at one or more JavaScript challenges, but I will 
have to look into Sharepoint as well today, for work.

I prepared my new domains (it-dudes.network, casa-vako.network and willy.codes) 
for email use. 
Now I need to think of a good strategy to organize my mail accounts better.

### 21:00

I remember why I stopped the JavaScript lessons on freeCodeCamp.
The second lesson is teaching me to use 'var' for declaring variables, while 
insted we were taught in the FSD bootcamp not to use that anymore. 
Instead we should user 'let' and 'const'.
However, after working on some more of these lessons, I saw that the difference
between 'var' and 'let' is explained.
I have now finished 34 out of 113 assignments.

Added a folder for willy.codes website, and adapted my personal website 
template for use there. At least for the time being.


## 25 August 2023
I haven't gotten to working on the freeCodeCamp lessons today, but I did work
on a Node.js course on Udemy, which is quite enlightening to me.

## 26 August 2023
Yesterday I spent quite some time on Udemy, following the node.js course by 
[Ryan Dhungel](https://www.udemy.com/user/e4938520-fe50-4d1b-b78d-4188406b14a9/).
Although it seems that the node.js version (10.x) used in the course is from quite 
a while back (2019 as I've seen in one video, I've been able to follow the steps 
so far, enjoying what I've learnt.

I'll continue today, but I also want to try and find the time for a lesson on
freeCodeCamp, which I totally skipped today.

Another idea that popped into my mind today was to build some overview 
of all the registered domains I have. 
The amount is growing, and it's hard to keep track of them, especially 
when they are registered in different places.

Following that, I'm actually looking for a good way to keep track of my ideas.
I get some ideas sometimes, but tend to forget about them, because of not writing 
them down anywhere.


## 27 August 2023

The past few days, I've been working on some Node.js tutorials/lessons which 
helped me with setting up a simple web server. 
Now, it's time to take it a step further and get it connected to a database.
I'm choosing MariaDB for that purpose, as that is running on my Synology NAS.
Using the guides on [MariusHosting](https://mariushosting.com/) is installed 
MariaDB into a Docker container.
Now I will try the [guide on Dev.to](https://dev.to/probablyrealrob/getting-started-with-mariadb-using-docker-and-node-js-3djg)
that should help me get my Node.js app connected to the database. 
That is the plan for today.

I seem to have some trouble with using the "dotenv" package.
As soon as I try to use variables from my .env file, my app crashes and I can't 
seem to figure out why.


## 28 August 2023

A busy day today, with a long but interesting meeting.
It seems that we're going to have a challenging time ahead at work.
A busy day also means I haven't had the time to code yet, unfortunately.
I'll see what I can do tonight, though.


## 29 August 2023

Another busy day, but filled with some fun activities this time. I've been 
figuring out how to get some data from our Sharepoint site, using the REST API
that is available.

Furthermore, I'm working on the [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) 
tutorial, as a refresher to my JavaScript knowledge. I will post my updates to
the corresponding [repository](https://github.com/willyvaessen/willy.javascript.info).


## 30 August 2023
August is coming to an end. 30 Days going forward in coding, learning and building.
Still working on the JavaScript.info tutorial, but also busy with finding out how 
to work with the Sharepoint REST API for work.

Also, I made some progress on the freeCodeCamp curriculum by working on the next 
lesson in the Responsive Web Design curriculum.
I'm built a Balance Sheet to learn about CSS Pseudo Selectors.
Next, I built a piano with CSS. What's nice is that it comes in three sizes, 
depending on the screen size.


## 31 August 2023

Day 31. 
A whole month of coding a bit every day.
Some days more than others, but at least a few lines of code every single day.
Almost 1/3 of the way to 100 Days of Code, learning and making friends online.
Today I want to continue on freeCodeCamp with one or two lessons, and maybe even 
finish the certification projects, but first there's work to do regarding Sharepoint.

End of the day: I finished the Cat Painting on freeCodeCamp and called it a day.


## 1 September 2023

A new month, a lot to do.
It's day 32 in my personal 100 Days of Code challenge.
I started working on responsive boilerplate, in order to try and make my designs 
more consistent on various screen formats.
This has led me to reading more about the Viewport concept.
Following that, I started working on a responsive website that adapts to screen 
size without having to rely on media queries all the time.
Although that's not entirely possible, I've come this far with only two queries, 
merely for the sake of having a minimum and maximum font size.


## 2 September 2023

Day 33. 
Time to renew my JetBrains license. I had been looking into this 
earlier, but their sales support stated I had to wait until AFTER 1 September 
to renew. 
Today I did this, with the 40% discount.

Worked on the new responsive layout today, which ended up being a lot more work than expected.
I'm happy with the result so far, but there's some more tweaking to do.


## 3 September 2023

Day 34. 
There won't be too much time to code today, so I decided to work on one
of the freeCodeCamp certification projects today: a Tribute Page.
Not only does that help me work towards the certification, it can also help
me get my "About me" page set up.


## 4 September 2023

I'll be building a city skyline on freeCodeCamp today, to learn more about
CSS variables.
At the end of the assignment, there was a little twist that I didn't expect, but I like it a lot.


## 5 September 2023

It was late last night, the City Skyline in CSS was a lot of work, but fun at the same time.
Today I'll be working on a magazine layout.

Finished the Responsive Web Design course and achieved the certificate at freeCodeCamp.

## 6 September 2023

A rather busy day at work and a birthday party today, so really not much time 
to code. 
I did do some Sololearn training today, though.
Not sure how serious it is, but I received their invitation to follow an 
Angular training in order for Google to hire me ;-)

Besides that, in between I made some preparations to move over to Debian Linux 
on my main machine. 
I've tried to organize my bookmarks in the various browsers before importing 
them to Firefox.


## 7 September 2023

What a weird day it was. In the middle of a meeting for work, power went down 
so I had to rush to the office.
There was not time to code there and back home, quite soon I had to accompany
my uncle to the hospital. 
He fell with his his bike and had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance.
So.....
Energy is drained, but nevertheless I'll try do do at least some coding.
I finished a few lessons of the Angular course on Sololearn already.
Now I'm looking at the Basic JavaScript course on freeCodeCamp.


## 8 September 2023

What a day this was.
Busy, busy, busy. 
Work, accompanying my uncle and out weekly family gathering.
Going to try a little bit of coding, but I think we'll be crashing the couch early.
Built today:
* Temperature converter (Celsius <--> Fahrenheit)


## 9 September 2023

fToday we've been moving around some furniture in the house. 
We changed our living room and office by switching them, so I haven't really 
had time to use my computer today until after 9PM.
There won't be a lot of coding, so I'll keep it to a little freeCodeCamp
JavaScript basics as a refresher.
I did some lessons on comparisons.


## 10 September 2023

Day 40 today.
JavaScript If Else statements planned for today.
Starting with the lessons on freeCodeCamp and optionally a small project to
practice with what I've seen the last few days.
That is, if time permits because there's still some cleaning up and
reorganizing to do im my office.

Worked on Is Else statements in freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Basics course.
Finished the "Going Deeper with HTML" part in the Sololearn Angular course.


## 11 September 2023

Day 41.I've been working on Switch statements today in the JavaScript basics
curriculum on freeCodeCamp.
Worked on returning from functions and built a Card Counting program on freeCodeCamp.


## 12 September 2023

Another busy day at work.
Today is also the day that the new iPhone is presented. 
With the little bit of time available, I worked through some freeCodeCamp 
lessons about objects.



## 13 September 2023

Today I'm working on some more lessons about objects.
Finished some lessons on Sololearn, in the Angular course.
Some more lessons on loops


## 14 September 2023

Went to the office today, little time to code during the day.
Today I've been looking at the next Sololearn lesson in the Angular course.
Next I went on with the next lessons on freeCodeCamp:
* Profile Lookup
* Randomization
* Learned about Radix

Finished the Basic JavaScript course on freeCodeCamp.


## 15 September 2023

Finished Module 3 from the ["Web Developer with Angular"](https://www.sololearn.com/learn/courses/angular-developer)
course on Sololearn.
I made a start on [ES6](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/) 
course on freeCodeCamp.



## 16 September 2023

Gradually approaching the halfway mark on my journey to 100 Days of Code.
With just a little bit of spare time today, I'll be finishing some Sololearn and
freeCodeCamp lessons in the morning.


## 17 September 2023

Yesterday, as expected, I didn't get too much time to code.
The same goes for today, as I've been doing some clean up at home.
Formula 1 today, and cinema later in the evening, so coding will be minimal.



## 18 September 2023

Today wasn't a great day. I had quite some trouble with my pc, not wanting to boot.
Because of that, I had a delayed start for work and didn't get to programming
until the evening.
I did some Sololearn lessons, and now I'm continuing with ES6 on freeCodeCamp.


## 19 September 2023

Almost halfway there, today is day 49.
I'll continue with Sololearn Angular course as well as ES6 on freeCodeCamp.


## 20 September 2023

Day 50. Halfway there.
* Worked with exporting (and importing) functions.
* I learned about JavaScript Promise
* Finished the ES6 course.


## 21 September 2023

Day 51.
I went to the office today, in The Hague, so I've been out of the house all day.
Now for some quick lesson on Sololearn and one or two assignments in the 
Regular Expressions part of freeCodeCamp, which I made a start with yesterday.


## 22 September 2023

Day 52. Almost weekend. Busy weekend ahead.
I'm trying to build a Python project today, that is supposed to help me switch 
drive mappings to different servers.

Finished a Sololearn lesson and continued on the Regular Expressions on freeCodeCamp.


## 23 September 2023

I worked on sololearn mostly today, in the Angular course.
With a brief introduction to JavaScript and some more html elements, I'm slowly 
working towards the end of this lesson.

I added the landing page, that is part of the course, to this repository today.



## 24 September 2023

Not much time to code today. We'll be out to Utrecht for the Pretty Woman musical.
A little sololearn (CSS Class & ID Selectors) will have to do for today.


## 25 September 2023

Today I'm continuing mostly on sololearn. Finished the "Getting Started wit CSS" 
lessons and made a start on box models.

On freeCodeCamp I continued with the Regular Expressions course.


## 26 September 2023

Another day on which I'll mostly concentrate on Sololearn.


## 27 September 2023

Thinking of the past 2 weeks, I'm starting to get the feeling of being in 
"tutorial hell" even though I promised myself to stay out of it.
Finished "Styling Elements" and "Transitions & Transforms" on Sololearn today. 
With that, the CSS part is complete. Up next is "Getting Started with JS"



## 28 September 2023

Day 58.
To the office in The Hague today. I continued on Sololearn in the train.
Finished "Getting started with JS", which was fairly easy, because I've seen it before.


## 29 September 2023

Day 59
Another Sololearn day it was.
"Operators and Strings", "Decision-Making" and "Loops" today.
Next up (probably tomorrow) is "Functions".


## 30 September 2023

Day 60. I started  on the actual Angular part of the course on Sololearn.


## 1 October 2023

Little time to code today, and Angular seems to be more complicated than I 
expected, so little progress.
Tried to finish the lesson for today, but it takes quite the effort.
Especially because there seems to be a difference in the way the Sololearn Code
playground works, compared to my offline IDE. A lot to find out and learn.


## 2 October 2023

Today I have worked on the Sololearn Angular course.


## 3 October 2023

After finishing the Angular course on Sololearn yesterday, I continued with the 
web courses.
Turns out that 3 of these courses share the exact same HTML course, which I 
finished simultaneously today.
After that I continued on the CSS part of one of those courses, combined with 
the CSS Introduction.
While all of that is mostly repeating what I've seen before, I will just
consider it "Easy certificates" and good practice.


## 4 October 2023

I will be working on Sololearn today, but it's also about time that I start 
building something that is not tutorial related.


## 5 October 2023

A day in the office today. Did one Sololearn lesson while I was there. 
Other than that, I'm completely empty, without inspiration so I'll just take 
a break for the rest of the day.


## 6 October 2023

Day 66 of my #100DaysofCode journey. I completed a 31-day streak on Sololearn.
Scratched the surface of what is possible with SQL.
With a tutorial by John Smilga I created a counter application. 
Really simple, increase, decrease and reset changes the value of a number.


## 7 October 2023

I made a small mistake in naming the directories for this project, which 
I corrected today.
It turns out that today is already day 68 in the challenge, but for some weird
reason I missed that.


## 8 October 2023

Day 69
No tutorials today, but building an actual app: Colored Boxes, which ended up 
being a nice little game.


## 9 October 2023

Day 70
After yesterday's project, which was a lot of fun to build, I worked on 
Tic Tac Toe today.

While I made one earlier, completely guided by a tutorial in React, I'm 
building this one in pure JavaScript. 
No frameworks.


## 10 October 2023

Day 71 wasn't really a productive day.
I've been cleaning up a little in my Go1 account from work, removing some 
courses that I won't be finishing anymore, either because they're old or bad 
quality.

Finished some courses in the platform, that I had already finished on Microsoft 
Learn and gained some certificates.

Not much work on the Tic Tac Toe game today, unfortunately.


## 11 October 2023

Continuing on the Tic Tac Toe game today, which proves to be more difficult 
than I anticipated.
Also working on an overview for a Python for Beginners course that I'm 
following for work.
Finished Python for Beginners on Go1/Stone River eLearning.


## 12 October 2023

I've been looking into some Azure development lessons for work today.
As for the Tic Taco Toe game: my checking code does not work as expected/desired.
It does what it's programmed to do, but is checking too much. 
I'm not sure yet how to resolve that and there's something else I want to loot 
into as well: getting my Raspberry Pi zero with attached camera to share the image.

Today was a busy day for work. 
I had a good call with my line manager and got the news that I will receive
a salary raise :-)
I started working on a little app/website to practice multiplication.
I'm having some trouble with DOM manipulation today and I'm tired so I will 
continue tomorrow.


## 14 October 2023

I continued on the multiplication practice project. DOM manipulation now works.
Time to get working on the code to check the answer against the assignment.

After testing my practice app on mobile, it became clear, that working with 
text input fields works fine on my desktop, but a lot less nice on the phone.
The keyboard popping up on the mobile device makes it work less intuitive, so 
I decided to take a look at a virtual keyboard instead.
I worked along the video ["How To Build a Virtual Keyboard with HTML, CSS and JavaScript" by ALB Dev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7I0SJ86NvE), 
building a complete keyboard and adapted that to a numeric keyboard.
NOW, I want to work out that keyboard "to perfection" so I'm playing around
with the design, to make it fit nicely on the screen.

A new week and a new idea to work on.
Or rather, an idea that I had for quite some time, but for which I have found
a possibly interesting resource to help me build it.
After building the virtual keyboard this past weekend, I came across three video's 
by the same person, so I'm looking into that to see if it can help me build 
the chat application that I have in mind.

UPDATE: Worked on the chat app, but it turned out to be less useful than expected 
in terms of actually chatting. 
Despite that, the explanation was quite clear, and I did learn a little more 
about DOM manipulation.

Also, if time permits, I'll work on tweaking the practice app a little more.

Today I will be trying to get a MongoDB up and running on one of my 
Raspberry Pi's.
I've had so much trouble with getting MariaDB set up on my Synology, in terms 
of connecting, and I see so many posts without an actual solution that I decided
to have a closer look at Mongo, which seems to be a more popular option anyway.

Also, I wanted to have a look at the "CSS font-stretch Property" for an idea I have.


EOD: Well, getting Mongo installed is even more challenging than expected.
At least: on my Raspberry Pi that is. 
Even with some comprehensive tutorial I was unable to get it done.
My last attempt will be to have it installed in a virtual machine or Docker.
However, Docker would require me to dive into that again, for which I may not 
have the time right now.


## 18 October 2023

I'm going to try and figure out what works best to work with databases.
On one hand I might have to let go of the desire to run it on my own systems,
even though I have enough hardware.
On the other hand, that could just be part of the challenge and fun to get it
up and running, despite taking lots of time.


## 19 October 2023

Not really much done today. I went to the office, which was quite busy.
Worked on Sololearn, Hyperskill and a little on the Odin project, but only a 
little.


## 20 October 2023

A rainy day, today is.
Feeling less motivated to get stuff done, but I'm determined to do at least a 
little bit.
Nonetheless, I worked a little on something I want to try out: creating an 
HTML "terminal", for text-based stuff. I started with a small version that fits
my mobile phone screen, for the simple reason that it's a lot less characters
to generate (32 columns, 10 rows).
JavaScript generates the rows and colums.


## 21 October 2023

I'm continuing on my terminal try out thingy. 
The grid is now populated by a function, which is triggered by clicking the
Start button.


## 22 October 2023

I decided to have a closer look at regular expressions, since that was not
entirely clear to me when working through that on freeCodeCamp.org

On https://regexlearn.com I found lessons that seem to explain it quite well, 
so I'll be working my way through those lessons.


## 23 October 2023

I'm heading to the office today, so I'm not sure how much time I will have to
code.
I will be working on the RegEx lessons though.


## 24 October 2023

Today I will be looking at the last six lessons on regexlearn.com.
From the lessons it has become a little more clear how it all works, but I will
need practice with it, and find out how I can work with regular expressions.
While I'm certain there are very good reasons for them to exist,  I have not 
seen a real-world scenario yet where I benefit from it.
I hope I will soon find out.

Finished two more "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects" on
freeCodeCamp for the certification.


## 25 October

Not much has happened today.
I installed Ubuntu Linux on my desktop machine and worked on a lesson on 
Sololearn.


## 26 October 2023

Today I've been working on installing Ubuntu in a Parallels VM and configuring
it to work with PyCharm.
Worked on some freeCodeCamp lessons today.
