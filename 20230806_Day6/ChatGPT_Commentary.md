## index.html
The HTML code provided defines a basic webpage, including its structure and content. Let's go through the code and understand its components:

1. The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration specifies the document type and version (HTML5 in this case).

2. The `<html>` element represents the root of an HTML document and contains two attributes:
    - `lang`: Specifies the language of the document (English in this case).
    - `head`: Contains metadata and links to external resources.

3. The `<head>` section contains metadata and links to CSS stylesheets. Here's what's included:
    - Character set and viewport settings.
    - The page title, which will be displayed in the browser tab.
    - Links to reset.css (a CSS reset file) and font-awesome.css (a library for icons).
    - Link to the main CSS file ("styles.css").

4. The `<body>` element contains the visible content of the webpage.

5. The `<div class="landscape-text">` represents a portion of the site that will only be visible once the user turns their mobile device to landscape mode. It contains an image and a paragraph asking the user to rotate their device for a better experience.

6. The main content of the page is structured using multiple `<section>` elements:

    - `<section class="profile-picture">`: This section is used to display the profile picture and a heading.

    - `<section class="wrapper-header">`: This section contains the profile name, headline, and location.

    - `<section class="profile-spotlight">`: This section will contain a button later on. Currently, it has a heading and a placeholder text.

    - `<section class="profile-content">`: This section contains introductory text about the profile.

    - `<section id="HiddenMail" class="hidden-element">`: This section contains contact info (email) that will be hidden by default. It has an ID to link to it later.

    - `<section class="social-links">`: This section contains links to social media profiles. It includes links to LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, and Discord.

7. The social media links are represented using the `<a>` element. Each link is styled with an inline SVG image, which serves as the social media icon.

The HTML code is setting up the structure and content of the webpage, and the visible presentation (styling) will be defined in the linked CSS files: "reset.css" and "styles.css". The use of Font Awesome icons provides icons for social media links. If you'd like, I can help you understand the CSS styles applied or provide assistance with other aspects of the webpage.


## Reset.css
The code you provided is a typical example of a CSS reset. It is used to reset the default styling of HTML elements to create a consistent starting point for web page styling across different browsers. The purpose of this reset is to reduce browser inconsistencies and ensure that elements are displayed consistently regardless of the browser's default styles.

Let's go through the code to understand what it does:

1. Selectors: The code uses various selectors like element names (e.g., `html`, `body`, `div`, `a`, `p`, etc.), as well as some pseudo-elements (e.g., `::before` and `::after`) to target a wide range of HTML elements.

2. CSS Properties:
    - `margin`, `padding`, and `border`: All set to `0`, which removes any default spacing and borders.
    - `font-size`: Set to `100%`, which ensures the font size of each element remains at the default size defined by the browser.
    - `font`: The `font: inherit;` property is commented out. If it were active, it would attempt to inherit the font properties from the parent element.
    - `vertical-align`: Set to `baseline`, which aligns inline elements vertically based on their baseline.

By applying this reset at the beginning of a CSS file, web developers can start with a clean slate and then proceed to apply their own styles, knowing that all elements have consistent initial properties.

It's important to note that CSS resets have become less popular in recent years, as modern CSS frameworks and methodologies often come with their own set of normalized styles. Additionally, CSS resets can lead to a loss of some useful default browser styles. Many developers now prefer using a "normalize.css" approach that preserves useful browser styles while still achieving a consistent base across different browsers.

## Styles.css
The provided "styles.css" file contains CSS code that styles the elements of a web page. Here's a breakdown of the styles and their purpose:

1. General Styles:
    - The `box-sizing: border-box;` rule is applied to all elements to include padding and border in the element's total width and height.
    - The `html` and `body` elements are set to have a height of 100% and no margin or padding.

2. Body Styles:
    - The `body` element is styled with a linear gradient background and specific font properties.

3. Spacers:
    - Paragraphs (`p`) and heading level 4 (`h4`) elements are set to have a font size of 16px.
    - Heading level 6 (`h6`) elements are hidden (not displayed).

4. Variables:
    - A CSS custom property (`--wrapper-background-color`) is defined to set the background color for various wrapper elements.

5. Profile Wrapper Styles:
    - The `.profile-wrapper` class styles the overall container of the profile information.
    - The `.profile-picture` class contains styles for the profile picture and related containers.

6. Header Styles:
    - The `.wrapper-header` class styles the header area.
    - The `.header-title` class styles the header title text.
    - Styles for titles (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`) are not included in this part of the code.

7. Profile Spotlight Styles:
    - The `.profile-spotlight` class styles a spotlight area for the profile.
    - The `.profile-button` class styles a button in the profile spotlight.

8. Profile Content Styles:
    - The `.profile-content` class styles the main content area of the profile.

9. Social Links Styles:
    - The `.social-links` class styles a container for social media links.
    - Icons inside the social links are styled with the `.icon` class.
    - The `.social-links i:hover` selector provides a hover effect on icons.

10. Footer Styles:
    - The `.wrapper-footer` class styles the footer area.
    - The `.wrapper-footer p` selector styles paragraphs within the footer.

11. Hidden/Visible Element Styles:
    - Styles are defined to hide and show elements based on their `id` attribute (using `:target` pseudo-class).

12. Landscape Text Styles:
    - Styles to hide text on landscape-oriented mobile devices using media queries.

Note: Some styles, like titles and headings, are mentioned in comments but not included in the provided code snippet. They may exist elsewhere in the CSS file.

This CSS code provides a basic structure for styling a web page with a profile section, spotlight, and social links. The actual appearance will depend on the HTML structure and the usage of these styles within the HTML file.

## SVG Explanation
You're welcome! I'd be happy to explain how the SVG icons are displayed on your website without uploading the files to your web host.

When you use SVG icons in your website, there are two common ways they can be displayed:

1. Inline SVG: In this approach, the SVG code is directly embedded into your HTML file. Instead of referencing an external SVG file with an `<img>` tag or a CSS background, you include the SVG markup directly within the HTML document. For example:

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24" height="24">
  <!-- SVG code for the icon paths and shapes goes here -->
</svg>
```

When you use inline SVG, the SVG code becomes a part of the HTML file itself. So, even if you haven't uploaded the individual SVG files to your web host, the icons will still be displayed correctly because the SVG code is present in the HTML that is being served to the users.

2. External SVG Sprites or Icon Fonts: Instead of using individual SVG files, you might use an external SVG sprite or an icon font library. SVG sprites are single SVG files that contain multiple SVG symbols/icons as `<symbol>` elements. Icon fonts use font files that have icons mapped to specific characters.

In both cases, the SVG icons are not referenced as separate files in the HTML or CSS. Instead, they are loaded as part of the main CSS or SVG sprite file. The icons are then displayed on the web page by referencing their respective symbols or characters in the HTML or CSS.

The advantage of using inline SVG or external SVG sprites/icon fonts is that it reduces the number of HTTP requests, making the web page load faster. Additionally, since the icons are embedded directly into the HTML or loaded as part of the CSS, you don't need to upload individual SVG files to your web host. The icons are included in the main HTML or CSS files themselves.

It's important to note that if you are using a third-party icon library or an external SVG sprite, the icons will continue to be displayed as long as the library or sprite file is accessible to your website. If the library or sprite file is hosted on a separate server (not your web host), then it will be fetched from that server when the page is loaded.
